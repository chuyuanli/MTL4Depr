The kitchen stinks . __eou__ I'll throw out the garbage . __eou__
So Dick , how about getting some coffee for tonight ? __eou__ Coffee ? I don ’ t honestly like that kind of stuff . __eou__ Come on , you can at least try a little , besides your cigarette . __eou__ What ’ s wrong with that ? Cigarette is the thing I go crazy for . __eou__ Not for me , Dick . __eou__
Are things still going badly with your houseguest ? __eou__ Getting worse . Now he ’ s eating me out of house and home . I ’ Ve tried talking to him but it all goes in one ear and out the other . He makes himself at home , which is fine . But what really gets me is that yesterday he walked into the living room in the raw and I had company over ! That was the last straw . __eou__ Leo , I really think you ’ re beating around the bush with this guy . I know he used to be your best friend in college , but I really think it ’ s time to lay down the law . __eou__ You ’ re right . Everything is probably going to come to a head tonight . I ’ ll keep you informed . __eou__
